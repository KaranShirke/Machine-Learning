# Simple Linear Regression with SKLearn - headbrain

Regression is a form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between a dependent and independent variable.

HeadBrain uses machine learning concepts to predict the size of Brain in against of Head weight, we train,test, analyse and predict data from our model which is built upon the concepts of Simple Linear Regression.
